v1.33
-- Updated for 1.12 Patch

v1.32
-- Updated for 1.11 Patch

v1.31
-- Updated for 1.10 Patch

v1.3
-- Included localization and compatibility for German clients.
   (Thanks to StarDust for his great support by helping, testing and translating. He did everything in fact.)
-- Enabling/Disabling Taunt Buddy in game is now saved in the saved variables.

v1.21
-- Fixed a bug, where unticking the "Enable Taunt Buddy" checkbox wasn't really disabling the addon. 
   (/tb [on|off] console commands was working) 

v1.2
-- Added a simple GUI for easier configuration.
-- Now you can also use the "say" channel. 
   The "auto" option will use the "say" channel if you are not in party.
-- Updated for 1.9.0 Patch (The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj).

v1.1
-- Now also works for failed mocking blows.
-- You can now make the announcements in a custom chat channel using the /tb channel command.
   Type /tb channel [channel name | channel number] to use a custom channel.
   You must be in that channel in order to use it. You won't join the channel automatically.
-- Taunt Buddy will now only be loaded if you log in with a warrior character.
-- Failed mocking blow and resisted taunt messages can be customised independently.
-- The "/tbtext" command is changed to "/tb text" for better consistency with other commands.
   Type /tb text taunt new text		to change the taunt resist announcement text.
   Type /tb text mb new text			to change the failed mocking blow annoucement text.
-- Changed the default announcement text for resisted taunts.
-- German compatibility and translation has been removed due to lack of feedback.

v1.1 Beta
-- Fixed the version number in the toc file. 
   It won't be 'out of date' for 1.8 clients any more.
-- Added localization support.
-- Added compatibility and translation to German clients. 
   That needs to be tested. There should be no problem for English clients.

v1.0
-- Initial version.
